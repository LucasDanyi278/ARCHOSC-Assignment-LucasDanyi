I have created new folders in my Workspace, naming them ArchOSC Assignment and Pictures.

I have opened a terminal inside of the ArchOSC Assignment folder and typed in git init, showing it initialized an empty git repository in that folder.

I have used the terminal to connect the local Github repository to the online Github repository.

I have opened visual studio code, and copied code in. Then, I have opened the html file from the workspace and got this as an output.

I have accessed the website from Github deployments.

### Reflection
Today I have used the terminal and visual studio code to create a website, document my work, and update my work to Github. This will be beneficial learning to help utilise Github. Github is very useful for team organisations where many users can cooperate into a big project that's stored within a website.
